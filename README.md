Flora-Christmas-Tree
====================

AdaFruit Flora + LM303 + Some NeoPixels and some felt make for a fun wearable-lighted-christmas tree suitable for any company ugly sweater holiday party

This project depends on a couple of [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit) libraries:

**NeoPixel**

*Although I have made some minor improvements for those wanting to incorporate the class directly into their own custom classes:* https://github.com/gschandler/Adafruit_NeoPixel

**LSM303**
